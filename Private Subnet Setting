# Web App Configuration and Bastion Host Setup 

# This manual helps the process of SSHing into an EC2 instance in a private subnet
# using a Bastion host and updating the web app configuration after uploading an SSL certificate.

# Step 1: Launch a Bastion Host in the Public Subnet

echo "Launching a Bastion Host in the Public Subnet..."

# Launch the Bastion Host
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --instance-type t2.micro --key-name ec2-keypair \
--security-group-ids sg-xxxxxxxx --subnet-id subnet-xxxxxxxx --associate-public-ip-address \
--tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=Bastion Host}]'

echo "Bastion Host launched. Please wait for the instance to be ready."

# Step 2: SSH into the Bastion Host

echo "SSH into the Bastion Host..."

# Start the SSH agent if not already running
echo "Starting SSH agent..."
Start-Service ssh-agent

# Add SSH key to the agent
ssh-add C:\WINDOWS\system32\ec2-keypair.pem

echo "Connecting to the Bastion Host via SSH..."

# SSH command (update with your Bastion Host public IP)
ssh -i "ec2-keypair.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-81-86-144.compute-1.amazonaws.com

echo "Connected to Bastion Host."

# Step 3: SSH into the Private Web Server

echo "SSH into the Private Web Server..."

# SSH command to connect to the private EC2 instance (update with private IP)
ssh -i "ec2-keypair.pem" ec2-user@10.0.2.122

echo "Connected to Private Web Server."

# Step 4: Update the Web App Configuration

echo "Updating Web App Configuration..."

# Change directory to web root
cd /var/www/html

# Update .env file
echo "Editing .env file..."
sudo vi .env
# Instructions: Update APP_ENV to production and APP_URL to your domain name

# Update AppServiceProvider.php file
echo "Editing AppServiceProvider.php file..."
cd app/Providers
sudo vi AppServiceProvider.php
# Instructions: Add the code under the boot function:
# if (env('APP_ENV') === 'production') {
#     \Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL::forceScheme('https');
# }

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache..."
sudo service httpd restart

echo "Web app configuration updated successfully."

# Step 5: Verify the Website

echo "Verifying the Website..."

# Instructions: After completing the steps, verify that the website displays correctly and is secured with HTTPS.

echo "Website should now be secured with HTTPS and display correctly."

# Conclusion

echo "Bastion Host setup and web app configuration completed successfully."
echo "Your website should now be functioning properly and securely."
